# Bernardo A. Rodrigues

Hi, I'm Bernardo. I work with Embedded Linux, specializing in cross-compilation with the tools from [OpenEmbedded](http://www.openembedded.org/) and the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/). I also know some C, C++, Python, Golang and Rust.

In the past, I worked for the [IOTA Foundation](https://iota.org).
