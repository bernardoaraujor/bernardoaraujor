# Bernardo A. Rodrigues

Hi, I'm Bernardo. I work with Embedded Linux, specializing in cross-compilation with the tools from [OpenEmbedded](http://www.openembedded.org/) and the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/).

I'm currently working for the [IOTA Foundation](https://iota.org).

Please check [ꙮ honeycombOS 🍯](https://honeycombOS.github.io), an Embedded Linux Distribution tailored for IOTA nodes, clients and Tangle related tools. It is mainly based on [Poky](https://www.yoctoproject.org/software-item/poky/).
